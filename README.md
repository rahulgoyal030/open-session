# open-session
## Problem We try to solve
=>Bridge the gap between the  top-tier college students and low-mediun tier college students <br>
=>Providing Quality Education to Students in Remote Areas<br>
=>Mentorship to Students at a single platform <br>
=>Peer to Peer sessions that allow students to understand the solutions better<br>


## What it does
=>Live Streaming of the sessions allow people to ask questions on the forum <br>
=>People can request for a session from an expert directly that may be not be generally available<br>
=>Organizations/Institutions can also host live sessions/classes to cover the students that cannot physically attend the classes<br>
=>We have created a web portal that allows people to host and attend sessions on different topics.<br>

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
=>No combined portal for sessions as well as connecting with different people <br>
=>Allowing Students to connect to give sessions and connect outside their arena<br>
=>This portal can improve the learning capabilities of the students(Peer learning module).<br>

## Technology used
=> Node.js<br>
=> MySql<br>
=> Jquery<br>
